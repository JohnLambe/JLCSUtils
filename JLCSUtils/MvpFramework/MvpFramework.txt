Each module of a system has its own namespace (under the system's namespace), with the following sub-namespaces:
  View
  ViewInterface (OR items that would go here could just be in the module's namespace): The interface of the View and types related to the View shared between View and Presenter.
  Presenter
  Model
Anything else in the module's namespace can be referenced by all of these namespaces.

Access Rules (to prevent MVP violations):
  Model (anything in a 'Model' namespace) cannot reference View or Presenter (namespaces).
  Presesnter can't reference View (but references ViewInterface).
  Model can't reference UI system (WinForms in this case).
  Maybe: Presenter can't reference UI system (WinForms in this case).
  Only designated namespaces (ORM framework and specified custom code (probably a library)) can directly access the database system.

Automated enforcement:
  Some of these could be enforced by a security manager (or a class loader in Java).
  Static analysis by Reflection could check for disallowed references in declarations of types (type members, including method parameters).
  Static analysis of source code could check more thoroughly.
