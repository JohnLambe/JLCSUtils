# JLCSUtils
General C# library, and dependency injection extensions.

This is released under a permissive licence (see the 'LICENSE' file), for anyone who finds it useful.

It is currently mainly pre-release or beta quality.
There may be breaking changes to some classes before an official release, and I'll probably change the namespace.

I have more things in development, not released to here.
